    # mailtrain plugin
    #
    # This plug can be used to train via an arbitrary program that
    # receives the message on standard input. Since sendmail can be
    # such a program, it can be used to send the message to another
    # email address for training there.
    #
    # For example:
    #        (defaults to /usr/sbin/sendmail)
    #antispam_mail_sendmail_args  = --for;%u
    antispam_mail_spam  = --spam
    antispam_mail_notspam  = --ham 
    antispam_mail_sendmail = /usr/local/bin/sa-learn-pipe.sh
    #antispam_mail_sendmail_args = -f;%u@example.com # % expansion done by dovecot
}
